# atmegaStepperDriver  
  Open source stepper driver powered by Atmega chip

## Quick Description
This project was design to be used in my [Modul3D](https://github.com/eGuardianDev/Modul3D) project.
Now It has its own project.  
The idea to have simple, cheap, open source stepper dirver for stepper driver

## Features and design   
- [ ] Powered by Atmega chip (at the moment Atmega328)  
- [ ] H-Bridge design  
- [ ] Flyback Voltage protection  
- [ ] standart stepper driver communication  
- [ ] I2C communcation interface  

## Current Development
- [X] H-bridge configuration
- [ ] Connect the pins to the transistor of H-bridge
- [X] Protection system
- [X] Test protection system
  - [ ] for motor
  - [ ] power supply
- [X] Power supply for the chip
- [ ] Pins for communication
- [X] Pins for power
- [X] Sepreate pins for power for the motor
- [X] Calculate transistor resistor values
- [X] Change diode foot print
- [X] Add capacitor before transitor for smooth curves

## Notes
Not sure if the 16 bit timer is going to be used.
