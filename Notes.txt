Transitor need specific activation power (amps) to use at full capability
https://forum.arduino.cc/t/custom-h-bridge-circuit-not-working-when-adding-motor/379745
there is problem
if the powered voltage is change that will change the current and the resistors needed to power the grounding transitor
this will be really problematic
the diagram above will make the circuit more compact and use less parts, but can't
